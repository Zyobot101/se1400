                        Name: Ethan Lee
                        State: Minnesota
                        Currently: Master's student at Utah Tech University

                        Taking CompSci in CTE to supplement my skills
                        Never really a coding guru and was always intimidated,
                        but you can build cool stuff with coding and it would look good on
                        my resume: we're a high-tech, wired-up world now
                        Post photo of Minnesota that you can find in stock photos or whatever
                        Also have a Wix blog named Rookie De-Fi, which you can check out <a href="">here</a>

                        Both assignment and opportunity to document my learning journey
                        Keeps me somewhat accountable on my learning journey and coding projects, too
                        Getting Master's in Technical Writing, and this provides more practice with an actual
                        audience than writing memos to my professor (a literal seasoned English PhD, which is a narrow
                        audience indeed) would
                        Restating difference between theory and practice debate all over again, but made manifest this

                        Don't expect miracles or professional stuff, though.
                        Also, be patient with me if I'm wrong or off-base about anything!

                        Simple website built with HTML5 for webpages and CSS for external stylesheet
                        First website I ever built from scratch, so in case the difference between my first try and web
                        designers' slick, professional branding is apparent... that's why
                        Ultimately, I'm a simple man. Do more than the bare minimum, though I like to avoid flash,
                        frills, and other ostentatiousness
