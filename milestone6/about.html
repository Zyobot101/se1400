                        First off, welcome to my site! My name is Ethan, and as you might figure,
                        I'm the humble owner of Rookie Coding. As the name of my website implies, I'm just
                        an aspiring beginner coder figuring things out one at a time and building up his
                        skills piece by piece, despite a lack of natural talent and other stumbling
                        blocks that come with a completely different set of lingo, practices, and
                        workspaces than what I'm used to. A bit more context, if you'll permit me:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Raised in the Great State of Minnesota — 10,000+ lakes, Vikings fandom, and
                        mountains of snow and metric tons of ice every winter — I attended the
                        University of St. Thomas for my B.S. in Business Economics (with an Applied
                        Statistics minor), graduating the May before my family started packing up
                        moving halfway across the country to the (Equally) Great State of Utah — and
                        speaking for myself, I haven't looked back since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having found Utah Tech University and started working on my Master's degree
                        there, I also figured it'd be wise to take some Computer Science classes on
                        the side and brush up on a skill I had neglected and left underdeveloped
                        (despite the technical nature of my undergraduate degree and the modern world
                        we live in). To be honest, I was never really a coding guru and was always
                        intimidated by all the jargon and endless lines of code that made all
                        my favorite apps and software work — but at the same time, the fact coders could
                        build all kinds of cool stuff with Python in their pocket, C++ in their veins,
                        or Java in their repertoire wowed me and convinced me it was worth studying (even
                        if I never mastered it fully). If nothing else, it would also look good on my
                        resume here in this high-tech, wired-up world we're now living in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And now, here I am, taking my first Utah Tech Comp-Sci class and building this
                        site as my first major project. It may not be eye-candy or the most prize-worthy
                        software you've ever laid eyes on, but I'm excited for us to learn and start on
                        our coding journeys together. So please, do stick around!
                    </p>

                <div class="questions">
                    <h3>Why did I post this site?</h3>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        As I said above, Rookie Coding was spurred by my first Utah Tech Comp-Sci class,
                        which focuses on HTML5 and front-end web design. Naturally, this site is proof of
                        concept and a real-world demonstration of the skills I've acquired in class, and
                        while it's far from perfect or pristine, it lays a solid foundation that I will
                        build on in future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides fulfilling course requirements, this site also serves as an opportunity to document
                        my learning journey and share it with others, allowing it to both be of help to fellow
                        beginner coders with little clue where to start and a potential gateway to collaboration and
                        community if there's enough interest. If nothing else, it also keeps me somewhat "accountable"
                        on my learning journey and coding projects: despite my ambition and interest in all the
                        cool stuff you can do with programming knowledge under your belt, I've long put off actually
                        building up my skills and let my misgivings and intimidation get the better of me — and now,
                        that's got to change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, I finally have a platform to post my projects and experiments. They may not be as
                        slick and professional as what professional programmers and software engineers can cook
                        up with their eyes closed, but at least they're something — and for now, that's enough.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="questions">
                    <h3>What can you expect here?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="answers">
                    <p>
                        In short, expect a few amateur-level projects and my first experiments in coding something
                        meaningful: puzzles, games, and maybe a very rudimentary app or two once I've hit my stride
                        and am feeling ambitious enough to market or share my content elsewhere. As I am a beginner
                        (and Rookie Coding is a beginner-oriented site), please don't expect expert-level content
                        or anything market-ready — I'm not a professional engineer, I don't have a team behind me,
                        and I may very well go the rest of my life having access to neither.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, I also have a "Blog" page, which is where you can find my blog posts giving
                        English-language updates and rundowns of the projects, research, and other developments and
                        miscellaneous thoughts that mark my coding journey or otherwise warrant posting here on Rookie
                        Coding for everyone's edification. Games and exercises are fun and are the ultimate practical
                        demonstration of applied, real-world programming skill, but breaking it down and talking shop
                        in a language we all (presumably) understand — in this case, Good Ol' American English — lends
                        context and clarification that a finished product or lines of code don't provide on their own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For now, Rookie Coding's still new on the scene, so while it's just starting out and while I'm
                        first branching out, expect a trickle of blog posts and maybe one or two actual coding projects
                        on the "Projects" page. I intend to deliver and pick up steam as it gets easier, but again, I
                        am a beginner who's just starting out and has little preexisting skill with coding, so your
                        patience (and preferably, constructive feedback) would be much appreciated.
