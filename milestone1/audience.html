        <h2>The Target Audience:</h2>

        <h4>Who am I making this for?</h4>
        <p>
            Although users from all walks of life are welcome, my main target audience are fellow college-aged students
            and other young adults
            who are interested in coding and programming, yet unsure where to start. To that end, I'd expect most users
            to range from 18 to 20-something,
            and mainly skew male on account of the usual gender balance in the software engineering and development
            fields (though anyone of any age, sex,
            gender, or other demographic is equally welcome).
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, while I don't have high hopes about this site going viral or making it into the history books any
            time soon, I'd expect my audience to
            be widely dispersed (but mainly English-speaking, since this site is an English-language site). That said, I
            am American and write in American
            English, so coding projects, updates, and other content will cater towards an American audience by default.
            Nevertheless, coding and programming know no geographic, national, or cultural boundary, so as long as users
            possess English literacy
            and an interest in the relevant
            topics, feel free to stop by and hang out.
        </p>
        <h4>Why am I making this for you?</h4>
        <p>
            First off, I've been &mdash; and in fact, <b>still am</b> &mdash; in the shoes of someone who's always found
            coding,
            programming, and understanding how computers work to be intimidating and hard to wrap my head around, given
            all
            the jargon and the highly technical nature of the subject. And while I may be candid about it, I very much
            doubt
            I'm the only one who feels this way or has felt discouraged by the way the subject is presented, taught, and
            talked about by those "in the know" or endowed with a natural talent for it. Combined with my budding
            <aa href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/technical-writing">technical writing</a>
                skillset, and I've decided the best way to teach both myself and make the subject a bit more
                approachable to others
                is to take the opportunity to write about it and post my coding projects (as amateur as they be).
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, while there are plenty of coding boot camps and other more "polished" options, those can come
            across as
            intimidating, and maybe even as a deterrent to newcomers overwhelmed by all the new terminology, flashy
            graphics,
            and ease with which the creators and programmers &mdash; who overwhelmingly tend to be seasoned
            professionals or
            specialists in their line of work &mdash; toss around seamlessly and without difficulty. The rest of us,
            meanwhile,
            are struggling to follow and have to brute-force our way through exercises and develop a semi-makeshift way
            of picking
            it up ourselves. For some people, it clicks after a while. But for others, a clear path forward or how the
            actual
            learning process works is simply not laid out for them. With luck, I hope to help resolve that discrepancy.
        </p>
        <h4>What can you expect here?</h4>
        <p>
            As I've said before, Rookie Coding is a beginner-friendly space where I post my coding projects, so expect
            mostly games,
            small exercises, beginner-friendly challenges, and a few posts from me about how things are going. While I
            don't have the
            know-how to set up a comments section at this time, it is a venue for building community engagement and
            receiving your
            comments and feedback, so rest assured that I will look into that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not, however, expect any professional or extraordinary projects or feats anytime soon. While I am a
            beginner and a
            hobbyist, I am no expert or career developer. I don't have a team or a business behind me, so what you see
            here will
            reflect the skill level of someone slowly, but surely developing their foundation and figuring things out as
            he goes
            along. Improvement and larger undertakings will come with time, but don't expect a quantum leap from
            Tic-Tac-Toe to
            my first physics engine overnight.
