        <h2>The Competition:</h2>

        <h4>What's the market for coding like?</h4>
        <p>
            Overall, the market for coding is highly diverse and offers no shortage of options, both paid and plenty of
            free ones too. Everything from
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> to <a
                href="https://ocw.mit.edu/collections/introductory-programming/">MIT OpenCourseWare</a>
            is available for coders of all skill levels, attention spans, and walks of life (though some courses are
            more rigorous than others). This makes
            it difficult to recap the industry as a whole, but it is a dynamic, innovative, and highly technical one
            with its own set of cues and preferences.
            Bright and futuristic colors, more geometric page layouts, and more robotic fonts that lack stylization or
            curly, more antiquated characters set
            these sites and creators apart, which jives well with the fields they specialize in and want to impart to
            their audience.

        </p>
        <h4>What are the competition's strengths and weaknesses?</h4>
        <p>
            The strengths and weaknesses of the competition are multivaried, but there are a few key commonalities I've
            picked up. While they're obviously skilled
            when creating fun exercises, including fun and flashy graphics, and making coding accessible, they don't
            always make it approachable and often get lost
            in their own jargon as the instructors (who tend to be seasoned professionals and specialists) begin tossing
            around technical terms and concepts under
            the assumption that the audience can keep up. While this makes the industry "genre-savvy", it also makes
            them hard-pressed to meet beginners where they're
            at and slowly, but surely walk them through how the actual learning process works in a deliberate, yet
            learnable way (as opposed to just giving them one
            lesson after the next and assuming they will keep up).
        </p>
        <h4>How does Rookie Coding do it better?</h4>
        <p>
            Given this discrepancy, Rookie Coding attempts to address what most coding sites and options often neglect
            by making a space for a beginner coder aspiring
            to bring together a community of beginners, so that we can exchange feedback and insights as we learn how to
            code from a ground-level and build up our skills
            at our own pace. Professionals and experts are welcome, of course, but Rookie Coding goes the extra mile to
            keep it focused on the needs of beginners and
            amateurs who don't have all the jargon, commands, and updates down pat yet and need hands-on experiences
            trying out what works and what doesn't for
            themselves. In my case, it's a space to demo my own beginner coding projects, so that other beginners can
            test them out and gain insight into what the actual
            learning process looks like instead of relying on a pre-set, structured walkthrough that may come across as
            too polished or technical already.
