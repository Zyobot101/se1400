        <h2>Website Summary:</h2>

        <h4>What content does Rookie Coding feature?</h4>
        <p>
            As the name "Rookie Coding" implies, this is a space where you can sample my upcoming coding projects that I
            create in my spare time,
            mostly games, small exercises, and beginner-friendly challenges to start. Although I'm a beginning coder and
            don't have much (if any)
            experience on my belt, I see the chance to share my process with an audience and take your comments,
            suggestions, and (constructive)
            criticism as much-welcome practice and an opportunity to build a community where we can learn and grow in
            our coding together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having said that, don't expect too many advanced projects or market-ready products from me. I'm a hobbyist
            and a learner, not a professional
            developer with a team or a business behind me. For the time being, expect mostly "DIY" or "homebrew" things,
            as well as the
            <a href="file:///Users/ethanlee/Desktop/Summer%202025%20-%20Computing%20Fundamentals/se1400/index.html">SE-1400
                course homepage</a> with links
            to the usual course assignments and final-project milestones. After all, that's why this site's being built
            in the first place.
        </p>
        <h4>Where do I find content for Rookie Coding, namely text and images?</h4>
        <p>
            There's an ever-growing host of media on the World Wide Web already, so in theory, finding text, images, and
            other content should be easy.
            Unfortunately, IP laws and attribution courtesy &mdash; while <b>absolutely</b> necessary &mdash; limits my
            choices vastly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Per the above, I will mostly stick to my own content in the form of my upcoming coding projects. Having said
            that, visual aids are always
            helpful, so I may incorporate certain images, videos, and excerpts from my favorite YouTubers and online
            creators when they demo a concept
            or project idea particularly well (especially if their sites have a "Share" button that encourages spreading
            their content elsewhere). That
            said, giving due credit to the original publisher remains essential, so a clear indication will be made on
            anything that's not originally
            mine. Otherwise, I will be mindful of Fair Use guidelines and prohibitions on plagiarism.
        </p>
        <h4>Why should you care about Rookie Coding?</h4>
        <p>
            While I understand the appeal of more "put-together" programming sites or looking to professional coders for
            guidance, Rookie Coding provides
            a more ground-level, relatable take on what it's like to be a beginner programmer learning the ins and outs,
            making mistakes, and developing
            his process for the first time. I may not get everything right immediately, but a site that showcases what
            I've come up with and what I still
            need to do is a way to teach beginner programmers by meeting them where they're at &mdash; and more
            importantly, redoubling that it's okay to
            still be figuring things out (provided you learn from your mistakes and can meet deadlines and such). If
            nothing else, Rookie Coding's a
            learning opportunity for me (and hopefully, also you), and I'm excited for us to learn and grow together.
        </p>
        <h4>Why build a whole Rookie Coding site?</h4>
        <p>
            Besides fulfilling requisites for the SE-1400 course, a website affords me both a platform for sharing my
            coding projects and creating a
            community for fellow beginners. Sure, I could upload my projects to an existing site or platform, but that
            wouldn't be as "self-directed" or
            encourage me to develop as strong a foundation as I document my learning journey and try to provide
            something that I think is lacking in most
            online spaces. On most sites, I'd be one user among many and might be easier to gloss over, but on my own
            site, it's easier for people to take
            note of what I'm up to and what I hope to share with them.
        </p>
        <h4>What would I like you to do here on Rookie Coding?</h4>
        <p>
            For starters, feel free to browse around and check out my coding projects. Again, please note that they'll
            mostly be games, small exercises, and
            beginner-friendly challenges to start out, so nothing professional or extraordinary to start out with. That
            said, while I don't have a comments
            section yet, your engagement and feedback would be valued, so don't be afraid to leave comments,
            suggestions, and other (constructive) criticism.
            I hope to build a bit of a coding beginners' community here, and I believe this is a good way to start.
        </p>
        <h4>What's the goal of Rookie Coding?</h4>
        <p>
            Primarily, I wanted a space where I could share my coding projects and receive others' feedback, and that
            hasn't changed. But ultimately, I also want
            to make programming accessible and a bit more user-friendly for beginners, and figured that a site that
            documents the learning journey of a beginner
            writing and trudging through the learning process for and alongside fellow beginners would make it seem more
            <b>approachable</b>, more <b>learnable</b>,
            and more <b>relatable</b> than a polished, put-together site or business might. The idea is to encourage
            understanding and curiosity, not to deter or
            intimidate newcomers right out the gate.
